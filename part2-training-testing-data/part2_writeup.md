# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
    This model is more effective than the model previously created because now the modle loops through all of the values in the dataset, allowing for the model to show the training and testing data as well as the data that is provided. 

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
    R squared coeffiecient = 0.6398. The data has some correlation but not one that is considered strong or desirable in a model such as this. 

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
    I would say that this model is definetely decent and better than the last model based on the R squared value.
