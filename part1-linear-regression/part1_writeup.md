# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
    R squared is the correlation value of the data. The close the value is to one the more correlated the data and the closer to zero the value the less correlated the data.
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?
    136.52
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
This models accuracy is decent. I say this because the correlation value is in between strong and weak. To make this correlation stronger, additional data would be needed.
